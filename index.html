            Hello, I'm Kaixin Zhu.
            <br />I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence</span> at Hong Kong Baptist University, focusing on deep learning, computer vision, and third-generation neural networks (spiking neural networks). My current research goals are to advance and extend the applications of spiking neural networks and to explore transfer learning to inspire their greater potential. Additionally, I am further exploring the field of <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence Science</span>, working towards Artificial Intelligent Generated Content.
            <br />As an undergraduate student, I am endeavoring to study and explore to continuously improve my knowledge and skills in the field of artificial intelligence. I participate in courses and projects, actively engage in academic discussions, and try collaborating with my peers to expand my research horizons and collaborative skills.
            <br />I am passionate about the development of AI science and want to contribute to the development and application of AI technology through continuous learning and practice. I have ambitions to become an influential AI researcher and hope to contribute to solving complex problems in the real world. I believe that through diligence and hard work, I can continue to grow in this rapidly evolving field and contribute positively to future research and innovation.
